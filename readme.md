# SSH
## Setup SSH on GitHub Account

### Procedure
1. Install requirements.
2. Create RSA.
3. Copy public key from .shh folder.
4. Make/Goto .ssh directory on server.
5. Add public key into known_hosts file, this can be done on Settings on servers platforms too.
6. In case you have more than one key, connect on putty and add it with:
```shell
ssh-add path/to/your/id_rsa
```

### Requirements
- **Putty**: Software to use SSH. [download.](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
- *mPutty(Optional)*: Multisession for Putty. [download](http://ttyplus.com/downloads.html) 

### Create RSA
```shell
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -C "comment" # Linux
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" # Windows
# then just press enter twice to get the RSA
```

### Commands
```shell
ssh brownbull@localhost # Connect
# Once connected
ssh-add -l # see list of identities
ssh-add -D # Delete all your identities
```

### Honey I shrunk the files
#### Minimize Text
- **Manual**: use [UglifyJS](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/)
- **Auto**: Webpack
#### Minimize Images
- **Change file format**:  Depending on following uses:
    - JPG: complex images with lots of colors
    - GIF: animations, few colors
    - PNG: logos, transparency
    - SVG: simple icons, logos, illustrations
*More info in which one to use [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/gif-png-jpg-which-one-to-use/)*
- **Reduce**:
    - PNG: [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
    - JPG: [JPEG-Optimizer](http://jpeg-optimizer.com/)
- **Media Querys**: [cheatsheet](http://www.bsidestudios.com/blog/media-queries-common-sizes-cheat-sheet)
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
body {
    background: yellow;
}
    body {
        background: url('./large-background.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;
        background-size: cover;
    }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 500px) {
    body {
        background: url('./large-background.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;
        background-size: ;
    }
}
```
- **Use CDN**: pages that make the job of handling images for you.
    - [imgix](https://www.imgix.com/)
- **Remove metadata**: remove not needed data from image. can perform that with following examples:
    - [verexif](http://www.verexif.com/)

### The traveling deliveryman
#### Paralel request
Keep in mind the capacity of [paralel request by browser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/985431/max-parallel-http-connections-in-a-browser)

## Network Optimizations
### Debug Network performance
#### Chrome
- Open **developer tools**, F12
- Select **Network** tab
- Configure with **Slow 3G and disable cache**
- reload page with **Ctrl + Shift + R**

### Minify
- [JS & CSS](https://www.minifier.org/)
- minimize images
- combine files to create fewer files

## Critical Render Path
![CRP](/readmeDeps/CRP.png)
### Path
1. **DOM**
    1. Html
2. **CSSOM**
    1. CSS
    2. Javascript : Try to put javascript at the end, they block css to load.
3. **Render Tree**
4. **Layout**
5. **Paint**
    1. Load

### Files considerations
#### HTML
- Load style tag in the \<head>
- Load script right before \</body>
#### CSS
- Only load whatever is needed
- Above the fold loading
- Media attributes
- less specificity
#### JS
- Load Scripts [asynchronously] or Defer loading of scripts(https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript)
![webPageLoad](/readmeDeps/webPageLoad.png)
  - **\<script async\>**: this will execute in low priority anytime during html parsing, uses like google analytics or tracking scripts(third party scripts).
  - **\<script defer\>**: this will execute after html parsing, uses like stuff that will read on DOM(third party scripts).
- minimize DOM manipulation
- Avoid long running javascript

## Measure Performance 
### Tools 
- [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
- [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

### Other Resources:
- http://optimizilla.com/
- https://tools.pingdom.com/
- https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/mobile/
- https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/

### Additional image manipulation tools:
- [XNConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/): This free, cross-platform tool can handle batched images, and performs resizing, optimization, and other transforms.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac): This free tool is available for Mac and as an online service, and is specifically aimed at optimizing images for speed, including metadata removal (discussed above).
- [ResizeIt](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/resizeit/id416280139?mt=12): A Mac-only desktop product that lets you change the size of multiple images simultaneously, and can convert file formats at the same time.
- [PicResize](http://www.picresize.com/): One of several good browser-based tools that gives you lots of options for cropping, rotating, resizing, adding effects to, and converting images.
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/): This ever-popular cross-platform tool just gets better with age. Powerful and flexible, Gimp lets you perform a wide variety of image manipulation tasks including, of course, resizing.

### React Performance
At the en of the url put **?react_perf** then go to developer tools, then record something with performance and looking deeper on javascript calls now you will see the components used

### Tree Shaking
Tree shaking is one of those things that will get optimized and improved upon in the Javascript landscape. For now, though, the best way to use tree shaking in your apps is to follow this wonderful [guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-javascript/tree-shaking/)

# Testing
![TestingCycle](./readmeDeps/TestCycle.PNG)
## Unit Test
Test individual functions or classes.
## Integration Test
Testing how different pieces of code work together.
## Automation Test
Testing real life scenarios, automatically.

## Jest
Framework to make tests, just like mocha, uses describe and it.
[CheatSheet](https://github.com/sapegin/jest-cheat-sheet)

## Enzyme
http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/
### Snapshot
Example:
```Javascript
it('expect to render Card component', () => {
  // Snapshot will take a photo of the current component 
  // and from here compare it against future versions
  // To update snapshot just change ocmponent and use option u on test menu
  expect(shallow(<Card />)).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

## Coverage
Stateless component with Snapshot test in place will have 100% of coverage
```sh
npm test -- --coverage
```
